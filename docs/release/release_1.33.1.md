# Release 1.33.1    

## Changes
1. Allowed a controlBreak array to be passed in as a prop, so control breaks and hidden fields can be 
set up in advance of displaying the table.


## Simple Widgets Maintainers (These are changes only for the Maintainers of this project)
1. Added the props.controlBreak to the SearchSortTable component.
2. Modified the populateDropDown function.
